# Summer_analytics_Capstone_project
## Brief Overview
The project was about building models for Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots. There were three models we have to implement and showcase the real time processing of the pricing system through graphs.
## Tech stacks used
Language: Python \
Libraries/Frameworks: pandas, geopy, numpy, pathway, bokeh

## Detailed Explaination
1. Data input\
Loads data from dataset.csv .\

2. Data processing\
Timestamps are generated by combining date and time.\
The dataset is sorted by timestamp and system ID.\

3. Feature Engineering\
Factors affecting pricing:\
Occupancy ratio\
Queue length\
Traffic (Low, Average, High)\
Special day boolean (like weekends or holidays)\
Vehicle types (car, bike, truck)\

4. Pricing Algorithm\
The functions are generated for the different models and to create the competitor price.\

5. Visualization\
Uses Bokeh to run interactive plots showing pricing of different model over time.\
